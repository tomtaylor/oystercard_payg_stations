Oystercard PAYG Stations
========================

This is a list of all of the stations that will be part of the Oystercard PAYG
scheme from 2nd January 2010.

It was extracted from `Oyster_jan_2010.pdf` by running it through pdftotext and
manually reassembling the gibberish into correct station names. All effort has
been made to ensure it's correct, but I might have made a mistake.

If you can be bothered to add in more zone numbers or other station
information, that'd be great. 

Zones
-----

Not all zones are listed. Where a station lies on the boundary between two
zones, they are listed as "1&2".
